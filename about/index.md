# Who is Richard Hanrahan?

Richard Hanrahan has many arrows to his sheath. The most prominent arrow you may have seen him, er shoot is as an alternative Scottish Comedian who you would probably like if you sat down and had a conversation with him. But, unfortunately, that's not how the industry works, so you are most likely to have found him performing at the Edinburgh Festival, having appeared on and off the Fringe for the last 10 years under various guises and projects. In 2018, he finally performed his debut stand-up hour [{{isdoingthis.copy}}]({{isdoingthis.link | absolute_url }}), taking his delightfully off-beat pseudo-intellectual style to its logical conclusion, with a show that claimed to reassemble past audience interactions, by filtering suggestions through obscenity and obtusity into a madcap, multimedia debut - helpfully condensed as an hilarious recursive nightmare trapped inside a heartwarming recursive nightmare. This endeavour earned him critical acclaim and a small financial headache. In 2019 he took working-man's club comedian [Jimmy Whobblers]({% link jimmy/index.md %}) to the Edinburgh Festival in the inevitably titled: [{{anaudiencewith.title}}]({{anaudiencewith.link | absolute_url }}) which garnered a single, 5-star review from the Wee Review. Some of my comedy heroes watched me do this shit, so that was incredible. Since 2020 he's taking a break to have children and do that sort of thing for a bit.

Previous projects have included the production of [{{ididthis.copy}}]({{ididthis.link | absolute_url }}), a documentary about the possibility of changing the world through stand-up (or was it?); being one half of husband and wife video sketch outfit and podcasting behemoths Me3 Comedy; an attempt at establishing a Scottish political comedy collective in the form of Politigiggle; involvement with We Happy Few, a group of Edinburgh based pals intent on changing the comedy landscape, which included a short lived stint as one half of the comedian's favourite double act Hitch and Mitch; and in many years gone by, found member of the comedy sketch group Marigold. is extremely politically aware and definitely not just a posh comedian with his head up his arse and without any actual meaningful experiences to draw upon. 

But if you like your noggin titillated by a nearly Scottish comedian, maybe he's your guy?

Outside of comedy [performance]({% link roles/performer/index.md %}) and [writing]({% link roles/writer/index.md %}), he has been a [Graphic Designer]({% link roles/graphic-designer/index.md %}), worked in [Dev and Tech]({% link roles/developer/index.md %}), a [Game Designer]({% link roles/games-designer/index.md %}) and even larped as a [documentarian]({% link roles/documentary/index.md %}).

# Coronation Chicken Enthusiasm
I love coronation chicken, so much so that I started to pass it off as a character trait. I will not pass up the opportunity to have it if it is on a menu, which surprisingly it is. And the quality varies dramatically. In 2011 I wrote a tongue in cheek blog conceptualising what they would make at the King's coronation should the queen one day pass away - you can read the results here - on [the Next Coronation Chicken blog](https://thenextcoronationchicken.tumblr.com/).
