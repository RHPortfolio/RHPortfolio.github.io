As part of my PhD I produced a documentary which predictably documented me trying to change the world through attempts to do stand-up comedy. **Spoiler Alert** I didn't change the world - but did I? Or was that the point? Or was it? Who are I? 

Includes a PhD thesis if you ever fancied a read.

NB This project remains incomplete and unreleased as I am currently awaiting my viva.

# A Bit More Information
Part of what I was attempting to capture was an authentic depiction of stand-up comedy. We see stand-up shows, but when we see them they are often as polished as can be, by successful individuals who have trialled their jokes, trimmed them and toiled endlessly. Partly what this documentary depicts, is the trials and tribulations of that process - or does it? 

It was overly familiar, both in some tropes surrounding the grotesqueness of reality television, but also in the depiction of a documentary film-maker on a quest to make a difference. 

Only difference was never a possibility - which is why I was able to change everything. For somebody, even if it was just myself.

Failure was an important thread in my documentary. What do I mean by failure? Without getting too technical, it embraces sincerity and openness, while exploring ideas of shame, masculinity and appearance. On one level, it is of a nobody stand-up, and that process of struggle, of a means with no end in sight, touched upon that failure.
