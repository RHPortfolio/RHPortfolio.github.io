# RHPortfolio.github.io
Portfolio site for Richard Hanrahan

The site is built using the Jekyll engine in order to utilise the very generous free hosting provided by GitHub Pages.

In order to understand the files, you must have knowledge of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), which together provide the templating languages the site uses.

Due to the nature of these tools, the code involved is lightweight, and uses CSS to provide the more dynamic display elements.
