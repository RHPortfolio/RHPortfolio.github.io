**Flannable** is the propensity for an object to be made into a flan. Fruits and sweet things are commonly considered highly flannable, though often an objects flannability is a matter of personal taste; one could, for example, flan a wardrobe given the possession of a strong enough stomach. Curiously, its apparent literary opposite - the term "non-flannable" - is also used to describe objects that can be made into a flan. 

Under EU law, it is now essential that all objects indicate on an attached label that the object is either “flannable” or “non-flannable” (as applicable) and every year they insist that these tags are bigger than they were the year before; similarly, these must always appear to be easy to remove, though always leave at least a few visible threads whenever the attempt to remove them is made.Notably, flans are themselves, flannable. The world record for recursive flans is 11. NASA believe a 12th is possible given enough altitude, while some very clever physicists argue that our dimension is in fact, flan.
