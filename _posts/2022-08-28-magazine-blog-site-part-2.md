In the previous blog, we quickly analyzed a successful, clean magazine site ([here](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjkv9q/an-oral-history-of-tim-currys-escape-to-the-one-place-uncorrupted-by-capitalism)) and attempted to understand what made it tick. In this blog post, we will look at what an MVP might look like for our approximation, and attempt to prioritize the work that needs to be done.

## Agility and Priority

In business, tech has moved towards Agile as a process - and what this means, if we strip out the principle from the processes this tends to evoke - it means working towards a prototype quickly, and allowing a stakeholder to evaluate the product as soon as possible. This doesn't mean working quickly, *per say*, which often results in squeezing out the most value from a developers in a given timeframe. Instead, you must choose carefully the elements that are important to the next iteration of the product - and prioritise those according to the teams ability. What do we actually need to be successful in the quickest possible time.

For this project, the developer is... me. My time is valuable, so I want to get from A to B in short sharp bursts, and so will have a basic MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and not specific sprints to work towards. Our product must look and feel like a magazine style website. My priority is to have something that has the impact of the completed site without necessarily the depth in functionality.

Using a simple Jira board, I have written up three epics - an MVP (considered our 1.0 release), and then 2.0 and 3.0 to define elements which we'd like to have but which do not impact on that initial idea.

### MVP

All of these elements have been considered important enough to be required for the initial project prototype.

| Item | Thoughts |
|--- |--- |
| Layout and Structure (Single Column) | I wanted to ensure this was robust before starting other elements  |
| Navbar (Mobile Static) | A single black banner always visible, just logo  |
| Banner Image | Visual impact was important  |
| Text Styling (Headers) | Making text stand out was visually important to the structure of the page  |
| Inline Image Styling |   |
|Sign Off ||
|Table Styling | We need this to display this page currently! |

### 2.0

These elements are considered not important for an initial release, but would be useful to ensure a well polished end product.

| Item | Thoughts |
|--- |--- |
|Design/Colour ||
|Logo ||
|URL Structure ||
|Meta Elements ||
|Navbar (Responsive) ||
|More Content Display ||
|Sign Off ||

### 3.0

These elements are functionally interesting, but for our purposes - producing code that can demonstrate ability - may not be impactful for a site that won't have particularly dynamic content.

| Item | Thoughts |
|--- |--- |
|Video Embedding | May not be possible with current tech|
|RSS Feeds | May not be possible with current tech|
|Content Importing | May not be possible with current tech|
|Endless Scrolling | May not be possible with current tech|

## summary

This was a simple exercise completed to support quick and structured development of a portfolio project. Now, to start moving some tickets into production..!
