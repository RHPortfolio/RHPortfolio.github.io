#Richard Hanrahan Portfolio

This is the website you are currently looking at. I built this as an easy to put together project that could tidily demonstrate my ability as a front end developer, without being all flashy and dancing as you often see.

As well as this, it can be a home for a little bit of blogging, though my writing will be more focused on different projects.

##Technology
This project was a deliberate pure CSS project, to ensure I could focus development on getting the fundamentals right. I enjoy finding ways to deploy projects without cost and this website is no different - utilising Github's own GitHub Pages system, the site is built on top of a basic Jekyll engine, with the project rethemed with some simple CSS work.

This means all content is produced via a simple Markdown CMS. By no means the most powerful tool, but an excellent way to be in control of okay looking content. One of my strengths is I enjoy getting the most I can from what is available to me - hence using Jekyll as a kind of CMS system without any bells or whistles.
