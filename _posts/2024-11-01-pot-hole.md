The illegal substance may be more familiar to you under a different name.

Similar terms are employed for other hobbies. The most familiar example people commonly use is ‘k-hole’ which refers to a paralysing hangover induced from partaking in too much ‘K-pop’ (short for ‘K-orean pop-drink’). Not to be confused with an ‘A-hole’, who is one that has blown too much smoke up their own arse.
