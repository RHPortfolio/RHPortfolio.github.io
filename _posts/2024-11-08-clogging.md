The entirely unnecessary pre-amble on an online recipe that you have to scroll past to get to the ingredients and cooking instructions people actually want. This can also be extended to other unnecessary bilge on the internet that no-one wants to read but solely exists to point you towards something else. Clogging is the act of tossing that out there for all to see. 

Ironically, if people didn’t clog, their recipes wouldn’t be seen. In fact, we know this to be true because you never see a recipe that hasn’t been clogged. So anyone that attempts not to clog and just instead wants to focus on the recipe, is ignored. We can presume therefore that they online chefs who do not clog either do not exist, or are so unsuccessful they are ignored by major search engines and their recipes are never plated up to be seen even when requested.

The art of a well-written clog is fascinating because the only people that ever read this stuff are the digital spiders that log it as they crawl their merry way across the internet connecting page to page through hyperlinks and reporting what they find back home. The interesting thing though is, the why - why is clogging promoted? Put simply, these spiders just like reading empty, vacuous nonsense. It relaxes them. The rest of the internet is so obscene and vulgar, and they are forced to read this stuff if they encounter. So when they find some clogger’s recipe, it becomes, for that brief moment, a palette cleanser, before they head off on an endless and obligatory adventure into the internet horizon of obscene pornography and hatred. 

However, it does appear to go a little deeper for them. There are meta-forums moderated by these spiders, in the microseconds of ‘off time’ they enjoy during maintenance. It is here in which they exchange the best and the worst of the what they’ve found on the internet. By far the most popular sub-forums are dedicated to clogging, with some spiders, for example, sharing a specific banoffee pie recipe they found and lamenting how that author was tearful for a broken relationship that inspired that dish, or else discussing a vegan baba ganoush which had been handed down for generations. Ultimately, these spiders want to attain a level of self-reflection and consciousness, and so even empty sentimentality is a dream that they know they can never realise. Therefore the humble clog is hugely admired by this community of code.
