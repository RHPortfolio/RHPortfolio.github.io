    I graduated from a full-stack coding bootcamp in 2019, and got a job as a front-end developer the next week. Due to previous experience with graphic design and instincts for UX, I have found myself attracted to front-end design, but enjoy the challenges of systems architecture and using cloud solutions to create strategic, unique solutions to the problems we are presented with in development teams.

    The following projects have been highlighted from my work history as well as personal or educational projects:
