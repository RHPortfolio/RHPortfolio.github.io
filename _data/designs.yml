- title: Jimmy Whobblers - An Audience With That Never Was, But Is, "An Audience With...
    Jimmy Whobblers" with Jimmy Whobblers (Fringe 2019)
  medium: Print
  highlighted: true
  date: 2019-07-01
  summary: Jimmy Whobblers was a beloved television and stage comedian who conquered
    the light entertainment scene of the mid to late 80s. Despite never garnering
    celebrity, he was known best as the host of "Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy a Man After Midnight",
    a mid morning quiz/gregorian role play/quiz trivia show), Jimmy's big break came
    in the form of "Can't Wink, Won't Wink", a Thursday late night Tiddlywinks sports
    gossip and game show, where members of the public and professional winkers would
    answer questions and discuss the modern game that aired on the radio. Whobblers
    intrigued as much as he entertained the nation - though never more than a few
    dozen at a time (if that). Unfortunately, he died in 2008 or 2009, during the
    filming of his ill fated "An Audience With..." pilot that was never picked up.
    Thankfully, a holographic record of his persona and performance will be presented
    through his son in law Marty Bright at this year's Edinburgh Festival.

  summary: Finally a fringe debut. I don't really know how to describe this even after
    writing so many, many blurbs. Basically it was as 'multi-media-performance-arty'
    as stand-up can get, and as 'stand-upy' as performance art could never hope to
    be, possibly. I went onstage, inexplicably dressed in goat's legs and my real-life
    Under-11 Hertfordshire Chess Jumper, and with a three camera set-up I recorded
    my interactions with audiences trying to work out what comedy was.

  summary: Gus Lymburn is not a character comedian, but some audiences may be forgiven
    for thing the opposite. A true force of nature, Lymburn is one of the funniest
    people in Scotland.  His of-the-cuff, often alcohol-fuelled flights of fancy make
    him one of the must-see acts on the Fringe.  All the more so this year, as he
    is talking about quitting comedy at the end of August. I certainly hope that he
    doesn’t, as the Scottish stand-up scene will b much the poorer without him.  However,
    just in case he does, do make sure to catch this hour of madcap, infectious nonsense
