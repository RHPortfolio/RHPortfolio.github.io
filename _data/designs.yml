- title: Club Sets (Fringe 2019)
  date: 2019-07-31
  summary: In a festival that pours scorn on comedy without a poignant ending, one
    show dares to celebrate the purity of the undiluted, unadulterated and altogether
    far funnier club set. Instead of listening to shows hastily put together to meet
    the fringe deadline, languish in 20 minutes of comics top material that they've
    honed in front of baying weekend crowds... some of whom were dicks... Raw, Scottish
    and very, very funny with Jay Lafferty, Keir McAllister and guests. 'McAllister
    had a mighty stage presence and impressively high punchline ratio' (Scotsman).
    'Lafferty makes stand-up look effortlessly simple' (EdFestMag.com).

  date: 2019-07-31
  summary: 'A comedy show about definitely not wanting kids... I think? The second
    debut hour from the childless BBC New Comedy Award finalist and presenter of BBC
    Brit''s Socially Awkward Situations. Previous praise: ''Refreshingly intelligent
    stand-up that also manages to be achingly funny'' (Young-Perspective.net). ''So
    bloody good'' (Skinny). ''Hugely confident, hugely slick... a welcome offbeat,
    slightly geeky sensibility'' (Bruce Dessau).'
